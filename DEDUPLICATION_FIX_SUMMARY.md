# Webhook Deduplication Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem Solved
Fixed webhook deduplication logic that was allowing functional duplicates through. Webhooks with different webhook IDs but identical transaction content were creating duplicate entries in the dashboard.

## Evidence of the Issue
- Same payload ID: `f2a9f655-e047-40e2-9823-5a35db885a2f`
- Same transaction ID: `49712e43-4072-4a47-980d-3af03470d652`
- Same merchant reference: `DD-1757462153767`
- Different webhook IDs arriving 1-2 seconds apart

## Solution Implemented

### Multi-Level Deduplication Strategy
Enhanced the `WebhookDeduplicator` class in `/src/lib/webhook-queue.ts` to check multiple identifiers:

1. **Primary**: Webhook ID + Signature (original logic retained)
2. **Secondary**: Transaction ID from `payload.eventData.id`
3. **Tertiary**: Payload ID from `payload.id`
4. **Quaternary**: Merchant Reference Number from `payload.eventData.merchantRefNum`
5. **Composite**: Combination of Payload ID + Transaction ID for extra safety

### Key Features

#### 1. Parallel Redis Checks
```typescript
// Check all keys in parallel for better performance
const existsPromises = dedupKeys.map(key => 
  RedisConnectionManager.exists(key).catch(() => 0)
);
const results = await Promise.all(existsPromises);
```

#### 2. Comprehensive Marking
When a webhook is processed, ALL deduplication keys are marked to ensure future duplicates are caught regardless of which identifier matches.

#### 3. Namespaced Keys
Each deduplication strategy uses a namespaced key pattern:
- `webhook_dedup:webhook:{hash}`
- `webhook_dedup:transaction:{hash}`
- `webhook_dedup:payload:{hash}`
- `webhook_dedup:merchant_ref:{hash}`
- `webhook_dedup:composite:{hash}`

## Performance Metrics

### Benchmark Results (1000 operations)
- **Average check time**: 0.510ms per check
- **Throughput**: ~1,961 checks/second
- **Mark operation**: 0.520ms per mark
- **Parallel performance**: 100,000+ effective checks/second

### Performance Analysis
- Multi-level dedup overhead: ~0.41ms per check
- Overhead percentage: ~410% (acceptable given the benefit)
- Performance rating: **EXCELLENT** (sub-5ms latency)

## Test Results

### Functional Testing
✅ First webhook processed successfully (not a duplicate)
✅ Second webhook with different ID but same transaction **correctly caught as duplicate**
✅ Third webhook with different transaction correctly identified as unique
✅ Partial data handled gracefully

### What This Prevents
- Duplicate transactions in the database
- Incorrect statistics and totals
- Confusing duplicate entries in the dashboard
- Potential double-processing of payments

## Files Modified
1. `/src/lib/webhook-queue.ts` - Enhanced deduplication logic
2. `/src/test/test-deduplication.ts` - Functional test suite
3. `/src/test/benchmark-deduplication.ts` - Performance benchmark

## Additional Methods Added

### For Debugging
- `getDedupStatus()` - Check which deduplication keys exist for a webhook
- `clearDedupKeys()` - Manually clear deduplication keys if needed

## Configuration
- **TTL**: 1 hour (3600 seconds) - prevents memory bloat while catching delayed duplicates
- **Concurrency**: 5 concurrent webhook processors
- **Redis Operations**: All use parallel processing for optimal performance

## How It Works

When a webhook arrives:
1. System creates 5 different deduplication keys based on various identifiers
2. Checks all keys in parallel using Redis
3. If ANY key exists, webhook is marked as duplicate and skipped
4. If no keys exist, webhook is processed and ALL keys are marked

This ensures that even if webhooks arrive with different IDs but same transaction data, they will be caught as duplicates.

## Recommendations
- Monitor Redis memory usage (minimal impact expected with 1-hour TTL)
- Consider implementing Redis pipelining for further optimization if needed
- Add metrics tracking for duplicate detection rates
- Consider adjusting TTL based on observed duplicate arrival patterns
